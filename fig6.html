La Figure 6 représente la mâchoire intérieure qui a été forcée, la langue, une portion du palais qui a été coupée détachée vers et de la voûte osseuse contre laquelle elle était appliquée... mâchoire supérieure... partie de l'éminence osseuse qui divise en deux la cavité du nez selon sa longueur...les deux conduits qui se rendent aux narines..ouverture qui donne passage à l'air pour entrer dans la trachée artère..

Figure 6 shows the lower jaw that has been forced, the tongue, [along with] a portion of the palate which has been cut & pulled back towards the bony arch to which it has been affixed... [we also see] the upper jaw, a part of the protruding bone that divides the nasal cavity in two, the length of which are shown here [along with] the two ducts that lead to the nostrils… [and] an opening which allows air to enter the trachea artery.

“The ‘histories’ of insects produced by these 18th century authors characteristically braided together narratives of nature and narratives of discovery…  The whole “history” becomes a tale about doing natural history, with the story of the [insects] themselves interpolated within it. These nested narratives reveal both animal and human registers, shifting perspective from one to the other quite fluidly. Understanding nature, and the nature of living things, depended on these narratives, moving back and forth not only between animal and human, but also between individual cases and generalizations. Thus another function of narrative was to incorporate the particular and individual, with their contingencies, into a general account of the species, and perhaps of the broader class as well. Histories of different processes or different species wove together multiple interleaved narratives.”(1)

The bodily, the aesthetic, and the wild come together in taxidermy. Taxidermy is a hands-on craft—you feel and smell flesh, skin, bone, muscle, innards; you handle scalpels and pins; you cut, strip, scrape, clean, wash, and sew; you create a “body” from iron wire, straw, and string; you use clay, cotton, and glass eyes to model.

For much of history, drying was a popular method for preserving animal bodies—a late sixteenth-century French manuscript contains a similar recipe for “drying animals in an oven.” As drying causes shrinkage and obscures many details, this method was also frequently used to create odd “wonders” like a “dragon” made from fish skin or a “mermaid” from a monkey and a fish.
<br><br>
Réaumur published a book on the preservation of birds in 1745,  but he died before he could publish a more detailed work on the preservation of animal skins as he had hoped to. 
<br><br>
Preserved animal bodies were primarily objects of study, both while alive and after their death. They rarely functioned as independent objects of study themselves, but rather served to bring together depictions and descriptions of animal behavior, anatomy, and physiology, linking these various aspects to the physical body after it died.
<br><br>
Thus, the objectified animal body served to “bundle” together knowledge about the animal.

In the early 16th century, as more and more medical students began pouring into university halls, anatomical theatres rose to prominence as a new method of instruction. 
<br><br>
Participants "were fascinated by corporeal display, by the body undergoing dissection".(2) 
<br><br>
Demonstrations in these anatomical theatres were split into a dual structure of dissections and lectures. The dissections focused on the hands-on skills involved in autopsy and vivisection, and lectures would cover the philosophical questions that arose from the study of anatomy. At the time, the science of anatomy was seen not only as the study of physical, bodily structures, but also as the study of the "body as an extension of the soul".(2)
<br><br>
<i>“At one level, narratives served a literary or expository function, engaging the reader by bringing nature, and the naturalist, to life on the page. But as we have seen, they also carried epistemological weight. For Réaumur and his followers, narrative was a way to connect with readers, but also provided access to the truths of nature, from very simple details to more general principles…we might say that narrative order represented or reflected natural order.”(1)

At the beginning of the 17th century, the frequent use of dissecting human cadavers so excited the public that it led to a spike in the study of anatomy. The invention of the printing press allowed for a wider exchange of ideas, and more and more readers were exposed to the visceral, inner workings of anatomical study. 
<br><br>
Because the study of anatomy concerned observation and drawings, prospective students did not need to be fluent in Latin to engage with scientific texts. 
<br><br>
For the first time, universities could begin to teach the science of anatomy with visual representations, rather than purely relying on language and text. 
<br><br>
A surplus of newly printed anatomy books, many of them illustrated, led to an increased demand for human cadavers to be used in dissections. 
<br><br>
Unsurprisingly, it was rare for anyone to voluntarily donate their body for dissection, so royal charters were established which permitted prominent universities in Europe to use the bodies of executed criminals for their anatomical demonstrations. 
<br><br>
To further the supply of bodies, the government increased the number of crimes for which criminals would face the gallows as a punishment. 
<br><br>
Though the passage of new laws did allow medical schools to legally dissect the bodies of executed murderers in the name of anatomical education and research, they were also passed under the auspices of preventing murder. Worse than the threat of prison or hanging, it seems, was the possibility you might be sliced into before a crowd of avid students. 
<br><br>
Having one's body dissected was seen as a punishment worse than death, "if you stole a pig, you were hung. If you killed a man, you were hung and then dissected."(3) 
<br><br>
Even though this did work to supply medical schools with more cadavers, it was still not enough to meet the demand.
<br><br>
With a shortage of dead bodies and more medical students than ever, during the 17th and 18th centuries, body-snatching and “anatomy murder” became popular alternatives.(2)
<br><br>
<i>Body snatching:</i> sneak into a graveyard, dig up a corpse- bring it to class, use it for homework. 
<br><br>
Bold young entrepreneurs called ‘Resurrectionists' would steal corpses and make a profit selling the bodies to anatomy schools. (3)
<br><br>
The demand for bodies to use as scientific specimens grew to be so great that some anatomists resorted to dissecting their own family members, robbing the bodies from their graves.
<br><br>
At the time, there was little difference between an anatomist and an executioner.
