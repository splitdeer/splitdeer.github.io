<i>Dans la Figure 3, on fait voir en grand la portion supérieure d'un anneau pour montrer la position et la direction des épines dont il est hérissé.</i><br><br>

In Figure 3, the upper portion of a ring has been enlarged to show the arrangement of its thorny bristles.</center><br><br>

<img src="http://splitdeer.github.io/page3.png" class="page3"><div style="width:20%; padding-left:5%; align:justify; display: inline-block;">The broad definition of insect as a segmented animal seemed much too narrow for Réaumur when he published the first volume of his <i>Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des insectes</i> (Memoirs to serve as a history of insects) in 1734. </div><br><br>

<b>The nape of your neck suddenly alights with an itch, as if a mid-day breeze had itself grown fingers and decided to reach down and graze your uppermost vertebrae. You pull your hand away from the grub and instinctually raise it to the back of your neck, trying to rub the phantom tickle out like a knot in the muscle. The fine downy hairs trailing down your spine feel <i>sharper</i> than usual, <i>harder</i>, almost. </b><br><br>

<i>"A crocodile would be a curious insect; yet I would have no difficulty in giving it that name." </i><br><br>

In fact, he seemed altogether unimpressed by the efforts of his predecessors to corral the non-human world into constricting names & categories; he was not particularly interested in the qualms of classification: <i>"I have already stated enough that the part of the history of insects in which I am most interested is the one that looks at their genius, their industry." </i><br><br>

You rake your nails across skin- an odd, hot sensation blooming outwards from the center of your palm. The heat of it spills into your fingertips, up into the wrist, inching along your forearm… you are suddenly flooded with the feverish urge to dig. <br><br>

Rather than seeing the naming and classification of insects from their morphological description to be in any way essential, Réaumur prefers to focus on the study of behavior. <br><br>

In Planche IX, from volume V of his Mémoires, a splayed & dissected deer's head serves as the habitat, a formicary vessel of sorts, for botfly larvae- the real object of his study. His studies of flies that lay eggs on or in the skin of mammals were done for love of the worm, not the deer- who, according to Aristotle:<br><br>

<i>"All, while they are alive, have worms in the head; they are produced in the hollow part under the hypoglottis (the tongue), and near the vertebrae, where the head is joined on."</i><br><br>

Is this a story of a deer's head or the life-cycle of the botfly? <br><br>
