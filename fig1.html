Not-yet collapsed, not-yet leaking reek <br>

<br>It was once believed that the fall of deer antlers was due to larvae of flies that gnawed at the stave or rod where it comes out of the cylindrical base. Réaumur (volume V of his Memoirs) combats this error, and notes the absence of these larvae at the base of antlers from deer killed in March, at the time the antlers fall, and which were sent to him for this study
by Prince de Conti.<br>

In l'Estoile's journal detailing the reign of Henri IV, we find the following passage:
<br><i><br><p>
"We have been watching for a few days, in a house near Saint-Eustache, a man named
François Trouillu, thirty-five years old, who has a horn on his head which curves inwards that would start to pierce into the skull if from time to time it was not cut. He says when he was born he didn't have this horn, and that it only began to appear at the age of seven to eight years old, and that the shame of this deformity had forced him to leave his village, and hide in the forests of Maine, where he worked in the coal mines to earn a living. John of
Beaumanoir, Marquis de Laverdin, out hunting one day in these forests, passed near the coal mines. The peasants who worked with the coal fled at the sound of the hunters. The Marquis de Laverdin, believing that they were thieves, had them pursued; once captured, they were brought before the marquis. One of his servants, having noticed that one of these poor peasants did not remove his cap from his head, came closer to him and took his cap, which he then threateningly hurled at the ground; but having seen this horn on the man's head, the marquis had him taken to his castle, and a few days later sent him to the King, who, after showing the horn to the whole Court, gave him to a stable boy, so that he might earn money by exhibiting the horned man to various townsfolk across the nation. The man was bald atop his head, had a small red beard which was as sparse as the tufts of hair on the back of his head, and looked perfectly like a satyr ”(fig. 92).
<br><br>
This poor man was so ashamed to be displayed as a curious beast that he developed a deep sorrow which led him to the tomb; this sorry end did not even excite pity and they prolonged the laughter that had tormented him for his entire life by engraving on his grave in the cemetery of Saint-Côme, this flat epitaph:
  <br><br></i><p><p>
In this small plot apart,<br>
Lies a poor horny fool <i> (the original French is "cornard": a cuckhold. also, "cornes": horns) </i><br>
who never had a wife.<br>
Passer-by, pray to God for his soul. <br>
