<p><center> Fig. 1 </center><p>
<i> <center>La Figure represente une tête de cerf qui a été préparée, & disposée pour foire voir les bourses charnues dans lesquelles croissent les vers auxquels les Chasseurs attribuent la chute du bois... </i> 
<p><p><p>
The figure depicts a deer's head that has been prepared & arranged in order to show the fleshy sacs from which the worms grow. Hunters attribute the annual fall of a deer’s antlers to the presence of these worms. </center>
<p><p><p>
 To begin at the end, begin with the deer. Begin with its antlers. Begin with Réaumur, whose hands were those that cradled the rotting heft of this decapitated deer. Those are your hands, as you peel skin away from bone with the delicate precision of a harpist. Are you wearing gloves, or can you feel the gamey down of the hide stretched taught over the buck's cheekbones on your palms as you work? 
<p>
<center><i>La mâchoire inférieure qui aété forcée…</i><br>
	the lower jaw which has been forced. [dislocated]</center><p><p>
					Strong bone finally gives with a hearty "crack"; the <br>																																		 
  					sound you hear is tectonic in its violence. Feel your <br>	 	 
  					shoulders, the muscles of your upper arms, tremble with <br>
  					the force of your exertion. One hand must brace the<br> 		 
  					cadaver, the other must twist and bend bone away from <br>							 										 
  					its ligature, <p>
					 &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;you break the deer's jaw with one hand.<p>

						You are a scientist.<p>
			 			You are a butcher.<p>
			 			You are a philosopher. <p>

<i>"The bones of animals depend upon one bone, and are connected with each other,
like the veins; and there is no such thing as a separate bone. In all animals 
with bones the spinal column is their origin. The spinal column is made up of vertebrae,
and extends from the head to the hips. All the vertebrae are perforated; the upper part 
of the head is a bone joined to the last vertebra, and is called the skull."</i>
<p><p>
The practice of studying and attempting to classify living creatures is an ancient one. In Homer's writing, it is clear that by the time of Greek Antiquity, detailed understandings of human anatomy had already begun to develop.
<p><p>
<i><center>“he hit him at the join of the head and <br>
 neck on the topmost vertebra, and sheared<br>
 through both tendons” <br>
	<small>(Homer, The Iliad, 232)</small></center></i>
<p>
From Homer, too, one can assume that the ancient Greeks were intimately familiar with the bodies of animals offered as sacrifices. 
Bulls were flayed for Apollo as stand-ins for human flesh, most of the time.<br>
That poor fawn Iphigenia... 
<p>
Though to mention the Greeks in terms of either their visceral or scientific relationship to the more-than-human world, is to inevitably mention the observational writings of Aristotle, that old coot who history largely credits as the progenitor of biology as a field of scientific study. 
<p><p>
<i>"Our first subject of consideration must be the parts of which animals are made up, 
for these constitute the chief and the whole difference among them... <br>
First of all, then, we will consider the parts of the human body; 
for, as every one can best understand the standard of money with which he is most 
familiar, so it is in other things. And of necessity, man must be the 
best known to us of all animals... we will speak, 
first of all, of the organic, and afterwards
of the simple, parts."</i>
<p><p><p>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;Parts. Pieces. <p>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;With the stag's lifeless head sitting on a table, <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;the head having been sent to you for the sake of <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;this study by Prince de Conti, you gingerly grip <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;the cool handles of bonesaw and scalpel and begin <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;your work. And what is this work if not the work <br>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;of segmentation, of cutting into flesh <p>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;    to unveil the hidden <p>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;    orders and arrangments <p>
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;     of parts that lie beneath<p>
<center>the meat of the living world. 
                <p>
You peel back the soft spongey tissue at the roof<br>
of the deer's mouth in the same way that you open <br>
the hood of a car. <p>
	Within, you hope to find truth. </center>
