In Book 3 of the Metamorphoses, Ovid tells the story of Actaeon, the young grandson of Cadmus, who met an odd fate atop a mountain. Let’s say it happened in March. 
<br><br>
Actaeon spends an entire day hunting the wild forests with his hounds, slaughtering so much game that the slopes of the hillsides gush red with the rivers of their victims’ blood. Growing tired in the afternoon sun’s heat, he calls off the chase, directing his companions to retire with the promise of resuming the hunt early the next day. 
<br><br>
Actaeon wanders the unfamiliar wilds for some time, until he stumbles into a clearing- a valley, dense with pine trees and sharp cypresses. Shaded in the canopy, <i>there was a wooded cave, not fashioned by art. But ingenious nature had imitated art.</i> The triumphant Actaeon had unwittingly stepped into the sacred grotto of Diana, the virginal woodland goddess of the hunt. To his right, an unnaturally bright & clear spring trickling into a wide pool, girded by lurid, grassy banks; the pool where, exhausted after her own days of hunting, the goddess likes to bathe with her nymphs. 
<br><br>
<i>As soon as he reaches the cave mouth dampened by the fountain, the naked nymphs, seeing a man’s face, beat at their breasts and filling the whole wood with their sudden outcry, crowd round Diana to hide her with their bodies.</i>
<br><br>
Poor Acateon sees the naked goddess and she, seeing him, blushes. Having no bow or arrows near, she instead lifts her cupped hands and throws water in the young man’s face. <i>And as she sprinkles his hair with the vengeful drops she adds these words, harbingers of his coming ruin, ‘Now you may tell, if you can tell that is, of having seen me naked!’</i>
<br><br>
He quickly flees, almost surprising himself with the sheer speed of his retreat.  As he wanders back, searching for his companions, he hears the low rumble of barking dogs. Realizing that they are his own dogs, he sees that they are chasing him. 
<br><br>
Confused, he calls out to them, but instead of his voice, usually so proud and clear, he hears the deep bellow of a stag.
<br><br>
<i>She gave the horns of a mature stag to the head she had sprinkled, lengthening his neck, making his ear-tips pointed, changing feet for hands, long legs for arms, and covering his body with a dappled hide. And then she added fear.</i>
<br><br>
Even with the speed of four legs, Acateon, transformed, cannot outrun his dogs.  Soon, the whole pack circles him “and they sink their teeth in his body till there is no place left to wound him. “
<br><br>
As the hot, sticky life drains out of his body, he makes a horrible noise- not a human sound, though not one a deer could make, either. 
<br><br><br><center><i>
as crows fly<br>
in the dawn light<br>
on the cold hill<br>
the deer are running<br>
<br>
the thud of their hooves<br>
on the bed of the stream<br>
is the drum that rocks<br>
the roots of the birch<br>
and the wind that shakes<br>
  the birch tree’s leaves<br></i>

The larval form of bot flies, Cephenemyia spp. are commonly known as "nasal bots" by modern entomologists and hunters alike.

You place the scalpel back on the table, suddenly overcome by a wave of dizzy nausea. Hot, frothing blood swells into your face and you double over in disoriented, throbbing pain. Your mouth is flooded with tinny saliva, your tongue oddly slick & heavy. You cannot tell whether the crackling sounds that fill your screaming eardrums are coming from the inside or the outside of your body. The starched white cloth of your apron is drenched grey in sweat, and with each passing second, you are unable to shake the growing sense that the very composition of your being is becoming viscous, gelatinous; your fluids sifted and churning. There's something...moving... almost swimming through the filament pockets of your fascia. You watch in rapt, clammy horror as your skin's surface bulges with the undulate movement of sickly, swelling waves.  It has a rhythm to it. 
<br><br>
A stag's decapitated head gazes solemnly down at the distorted shape writhing on the floor.
