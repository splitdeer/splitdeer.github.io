<i>La Figure 2 est celle d'un ver tel que celui marqué u, un peu plus grand que nature...ses cornes charnues posées au-dessous des crochets qu'on ne voit point ici, parce qu'ils sont recourbés en dessouss... les stigmates antérieurs...l'anus... un portion du dernier anneau, au-dessous de laquelle sont les stigmates postérieurs & qui les cache actuellement.</i><br><br>

  Figure 2 depicts a worm such as the one marked <i>u</i>, a little larger than life... its fleshy horns are placed below the fangs [which] we do not see here, because they are curved below. [We see] the anterior stigmata (spiracles)...the anus… [and the] end portion of one ring segment, which currently hides the posterior stigmata below. </center><br><br>

Aristotle, and nearly all Western scholars after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a gradient scale of perfection- from plants to humans: this was called the scala naturae or "Great Chain of Being". <br><br>

René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur was a French naturalist of the early 18th century. The table on which the deer's head sits belongs to him, though he is less interested in the inner workings of cervidology than he is with the habits of insects. <br><br>


<div style="width:11%; padding-left:25%; padding-right:5%; align:justify; display: inline-block;">"Insect": originally from the Latin "insecare" meaning "to cut up or into" ("in-" meaning "into" and "-secare" meaning "to cut") becomes the Latin "insectum" meaning "segmented"; and the Greek equivalent "entomon" meaning “notched, segmented" (the root of "entomology"). The etymology of the term evokes the shape of these creature's bodies as arranged in segments.</div><img src="http://splitdeer.github.io/wormpage2.jpg" class="wormpage2"><br><br>
  
You trail an ungloved finger down the boneless, miniature form. It’s surprisingly soft, surprisingly <i>warm…</i> <br><br>

The grub blindly mouths the air around your fingertip, you can just barely hear its gentle shushes… it looks like a <i>child</i>, an <i>infant</i> even. <br><br>

Helpless and hungry, it can smell a river of platelets through the skin of your palm; its jaw-hooks open and close to a silent beat, pitifully impotent as it searches for a spot to attach. <br><br>

You trace the ridges of its elastic body, your fingerpad imperceptibly rising and falling over the crests, each notch ringed with a collar of microscopic nettles… <i>spines</i>. <br><br>

Aristotle included insects within a more general category of animals he believed to be bloodless. He thought that the segments of their bodies continued to live after they were cut up.  <br><br>

Thus, the term “insect” may also hold reference to a literal "cutting into":<br><br>

<i>"All insects survive being divided, except those which are naturally cold, or soon become so from their small size, so that wasps live after they are cut asunder; either the head or the abdomen will live if united to the thorax, but the head will not live alone. Those which are long, and have many feet, will survive division for a considerable time.."</i><br><br>

Did the deer's head just shudder? Are you imagining things?
