<i>La Figure 2 est celle d'un ver tel que celui marqué u, un peu plus grand que nature...ses cornes charnues posées au-dessous des crochets qu'on ne voit point ici, parce qu'ils sont recourbés en dessouss... les stigmates antérieurs...l'anus... un portion du dernier anneau, au-dessous de laquelle sont les stigmates postérieurs & qui les cache actuellement.</i><br><br>

  Figure 2 depicts a worm such as the one marked <i>u</i>, a little larger than life... its fleshy horns are placed below the fangs [which] we do not see here, because they are curved below. [We see] the anterior stigmata (spiracles)...the anus… [and the] end portion of one ring segment, which currently hides the posterior stigmata below. </center><br><br>

Aristotle, and nearly all Western scholars after him until the 18th century, believed that creatures were arranged in a gradient scale of perfection- from plants to humans: this was called the scala naturae or "Great Chain of Being". <br><br>

René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur was a French naturalist of the early 18th century. The table on which the deer's head sits belongs to him, though he is less interested in the inner workings of cervidology than he is with the habits of insects. <br><br>


<div style="width:30%">"Insect": originally from the Latin "insecare" meaning "to cut up or into" ("in-" meaning "into" and "-secare" meaning "to cut") becomes the Latin "insectum" meaning "segmented"; and the Greek equivalent "entomon" meaning “notched, segmented" (the root of "entomology"). The etymology of the term evokes the shape of these creature's bodies as arranged in segments.</div><div style="width:50%; padding-left:10%; padding-right 10%"><img src="http://splitdeer.github.io/wormpage2.jpeg"></div>
