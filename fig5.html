<i>La Figure 5 représente le bout postérieur du ver vu de face.... 
le appendice charnu qui est du côté du ventre et au bout duquel est l'anus
... les deux stigmates postérieurs et un partie du dernier anneau qui peut s'avancer comme
dans la Figure 2, ou davantage, qui peut s'étendre & s'abaisser jusqu'à
  s'appliquer sur l'appendice a, alors elle couvre les stigmates.</i><br><br>

Figure 5 shows the tail end of the worm as seen from the front... 
[We see] a fleshy appendage on the side of the belly, at the end of which is the anus 
[as well as] the two posterior stigmata, and a portion of the bottommost ring, 
which can bulge out as in Figure 2, or extend further out & until it sags and 
rests on the belly, covering the stigmata.<br><br>

Arthur Éloffe appears in the records of history as a rather curious character. <br><br> 

Aside from "Histoire naturelle des cornes" (Natural History of Horns), he is also credited as the author of “<i>Les Champignons Comestibles et Vénéneux</i>” (A Guide to Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms, 1880). <br><br>

Éloffe was born in 1826 in France, where he worked as a trained taxidermist in addition to running a naturalist preparatory business and a tiny school in the Rue de l’Ecole de Médecine 20, Paris. Éloffe taught his students how to dissect, clean, and preserve specimens. He published several works on a variety of topics- such as plants, animals and mushrooms- under the pseudonym Kroenishfranck.<br><br>

He gave himself the title of “professor of taxidermy,” though he neglected to mention any affiliation with an institution. The building of the “school” he ran also happened to be his apartment at 20 Rue de l'Ecole-de-Médicine. The building was adjacent to no. 10, the home & shop of another accomplished naturalist & entomologist of the early 19th century, Nérée Boubée. (Who, in 1845, established a publishing house that is still successful today, <i>Maison d'édition Boubée</i>.)<br><br>  

Boubée’s apartment, no. 10, is said to be the same apartment where Jean Paul Marat was assassinated by Charlotte Corday while in the bath. She hid a 5-inch long kitchen knife in her corset, which she then used to puncture his carotid artery.<br><br> 

Somehow, both the knife and the bathtub wound up at the Musée Grévin, a fascinatingly macabre wax museum at 10 Boulevard Montmartre in Paris, where they still sit today; arranged in a scene replete with life-sized wax renderings of both Marat and Corday.<br><br>

Many of Boubée’s specimens are still circulating today, passed along by different collectors. One assumes that many of the insects, birds, reptiles, fossils, and shells he collected and mounted in display boxes must be stored in the archives of museums and the various scientific institutions of Paris. That being said, I’ve found quite a few on Ebay auctions. <br><br>
