The botfly lays its eggs in wounds left by the bites of other insects.
 <br><br>
Consider, for a moment, the idea of a maggot living and growing under your skin, eating your flesh as it grew. I am uncertain whether or not deer frequently get nightmares- but botflies do, on occasion, burrow into humans as well. 
 <br><br>
The victims of botfly are generally advised to avoid any and all attempts at removing their maggot passengers. 
 <br><br><i>
Your mother lovingly builds you a nest in the mouth or nasal cavity of a white-tailed deer. This warm and wet cradle softens and lulls you into hatching. You emerge, get ahold of the unfamiliar dimensions of your body, and begin to move about the wet tissue of your home. You wander up nasal passages and meander into the sinuses, finding the perfect spot to sit back and grow. Now, more mature & wiser than ever, you decide to venture into deeper crevices, into the dark and unexplored terrain of the throat.
   <br><br></i>
The most dangerous aspect of being infested with botfly larvae is instinct. The normal course of action, upon feeling the bulge of a worm burrowed in your arm, is to squeeze out the maggot as if it were a zit and discard it. To do so, however, is to invite an even worse parasite: infection. 
 <br><br>
Once it burrows, the botfly maggot becomes quite literally attached to its host. As the larva grows beneath the skin, it makes an elastic casing for itself; a kind of parasitic placenta. Once inside a host, the larvae wires its case into a blood vessel using its “les deux crochets écailleux” et “les cornes charnues.” This is how they anchor themselves within the skin, and it's also how they feed.  If the grub is squeezed or dug out while its case is still hooked into your veins, it leaves part of itself behind, broken off. The part left behind dies and rots, causing infection. 
 <br><br><i>
You lift up a small, mucosal flap of skin and burrow in, where you'll gather the last of the strength you'll need for the journey to come. Well-rested and fully grown, you are ready to leave home. The walls begin to rumble and seize as you are pitched into the sudden weightlessness of flight. Outside the house, you hear a sneeze echo through the forest. You've landed comfortably on the ground, greeted by the rich understory smells of leaf litter and soil. In search of a new shelter, you instinctively look down, towards the familiar deep and dark, and shimmy into the grainy folds of topsoil. You fall asleep, weeks pass, and upon waking, unfurl your wings. 
 <br><br></i>
Those infected should either wait until they can visit a doctor—or just until the fly is done with the larval part of its growth cycle. Be patient, it wants to crawl out of its <a href="https://i.ibb.co/Sx88gBc/Screen-Shot-2021-11-13-at-10-19-00-PM.png">host</a> and fly away.
